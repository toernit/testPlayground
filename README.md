## 🧪 Practice Web Page – `web-demo/index.html`

We’ve included a simple **To-Do List App** so you can test something real!

🔧 Features:
- Add tasks
- Mark tasks as done
- Delete tasks
- Small UI interactions (clicks, alerts, checkboxes)

📂 Path:
```
/web-demo/index.html
```

To open the page in your browser, right-click the file in VS Code and choose **"Open with Live Server"** (install the [Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)).

Use this app to practice writing tests in all three frameworks.
